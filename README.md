# Unity HexMap Editor

This project is an implementation of Catlike Coding Tutorial.
The original tutorial can be found [here](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/).

Any new ideas or implementations will be stored in another repository.

The "reference" branch contains the original code for each section of the tutorial.
