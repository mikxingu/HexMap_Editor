### Unity HexMap Editor

This project is an implementation of Catlike Coding Tutorial.
The original tutorial can be found at (https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/).

This repository will only contain the files that I created while trying to reproduce the tutorial steps. 

Any new ideas or implementations will be stored in another repository.

The "reference" branch contains the original code for each section of the tutorial.
